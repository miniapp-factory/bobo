export const description = "Color Match Tap is a fast-paced reaction game where colored circles appear on the screen, and you must quickly tap only the circles that match the target color shown at the top. Each correct tap gives you points, while tapping the wrong color removes points and reduces your chances of reaching the next level. The target color changes after each round, and the circles appear faster every time, making the game progressively harder. With only a few seconds to react, players must stay focused and tap quickly to achieve a high score. Simple mechanics, smooth gameplay, and rising difficulty make Color Match Tap an addictive and fun challenge for all players.";
